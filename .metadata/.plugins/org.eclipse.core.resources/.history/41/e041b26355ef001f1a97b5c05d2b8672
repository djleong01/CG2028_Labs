@ Look-up table for registers:

@ R0 2D array for building slots
@ R1 array for entry events
@ R2 array for exit events
@ R3 2D array for results
@ R4 value of F*S = # of elements
@ R5 loop counter i
@ R6 holding the loop limit (5 - # of entry events)
@ R7 floor - curr floor pointer
@ R8 section - curr section pointer
@ R9 cars - # of cars at each entry event
@ R10 available - # of available floors
@ R11
@ R7 cars - entry[event]
@ R8 current
@ ...

@ Offset = ((i * S) + j) *4

@ write your program from here:

// return value from asm back to C program, R0 register is used
asm_func:
	LDR R4, [R3]		// Load value of result[0][0], which is F
	LDR R5, [R3, #4]	// Load value of result[0][1], which is S
	MUL R4, R4, R5		// Multiply to get R

	MOV	R5, #0			// R5 serving as loop counter i
	MOV R6, #5			// R6 holding loop limit, which is 5 (# of entering events)

FIRST_FOR_LOOP:
	CMP R5, R6			// compare i with 5
	BGE FIRST_LOOP_EXIT		// if i>=5, exit loop

	LDR	R7, [R1, R5, LSL #2]	// load entry element from R1 address + (i*4) into R7

	CMP R7, #0			// compare #cars remaining for that event >0
	BLE FIRST_FOR_LOOP	// if R7 <= 0, branch back to the start of the main loop

	CMP

	BLE
	ADD R5, R5, #1		// i++
	B FIRST_FOR_LOOP	// jump back to start of the loop

FIRST_LOOP_EXIT:

	BX LR

// 	PUSH {R14} // saves caller's link register

//	BL SUBROUTINE // call SUBROUTINE. LR(R14) now holds the return address

// 	POP {R14} // restore the original link register

//	BX LR // return from asm_func

//SUBROUTINE:

//	BX LR // return to the caller using the LR
